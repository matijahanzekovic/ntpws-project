	<p>A mockumentary on a group of typical office workers, where the workday consists of ego clashes, inappropriate behavior, and tedium.</p>
	<p>A mediocre paper company in the hands of Scranton, PA branch manager Michael Scott. This mockumentary follows the everyday lives of the manager and the employees he "manages." The crew follows the employees around 24/7 and captures their quite humorous and bizarre encounters as they will do what it takes to keep the company thriving.</p>
	<p>The U.S. version of The Office is set in the town of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The comedy show takes place in the Scranton branch of a failing paper company, Dunder Mifflin. It mainly revolves around Michael Scott (Steve Carell), the regional manager, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), the top salesman, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), the office "funny-guy," and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), the uncomfortable receptionist, and Ryan (B.J Novak) the silent cool guy.</p>
